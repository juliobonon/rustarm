# Running Rust on Torizon #

Rust is syntactically similar to C++, can guarantee memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references.Rust achieves memory safety without garbage collection, and reference counting is optional. From Pop!_OS by System76 GTK3 desktop applications to nmp(Node Package Manager), Rust is being used on several [production applications](https://www.rust-lang.org/pt-BR/production/users).

As written on the official [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/), if you are targeting low-resource devices and need low-level control without giving up high-level languages conveniences, then Rust is for you.
